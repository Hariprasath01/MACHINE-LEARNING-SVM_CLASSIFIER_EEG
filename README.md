❖EEG waves are typically categorised using theta band from 4 to 7 Hz, alpha band from 8 to 13 Hz, beta band from 14 to 30 Hz, and gamma band greater than 30 Hz. These five primary bands are separated by frequency. Each of these spectra is typically connected to a specific activity, such as moving the fingers, sleeping, thinking actively, or solving problems.

❖Additionally, emotions are important in daily communication. The word "ok" alone can communicate sorrow, grief, anger, happiness, or even disgust depending on the circumstances; however, facial expressions, hand gestures, and other non-verbal communication techniques can convey the whole meaning.EEG sensor data, face markers, or a combination of these with bodily signals like pupil dilation can all be used to identify emotions.
